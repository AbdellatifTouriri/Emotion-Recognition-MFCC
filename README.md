# Emotion-Recognition-MFCC
# Emotion Recognition from Audio Using MFCC

This project aims to perform emotion classification based on audio data using **MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** features. The model uses a neural network for emotion recognition.

## Project Overview

- The project uses the TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set) dataset.
- Features are extracted using **librosa** library to compute **MFCCs**.
- The model is built using **TensorFlow** with a simple neural network architecture.

## Features

- Emotion classification from audio data.
- Preprocessing of audio files to extract MFCC features.
- Model training using a neural network.

## Setup and Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Emotion-Recognition-MFCC.git
cd Emotion-Recognition-MFCC
pip install -r requirements.txt
